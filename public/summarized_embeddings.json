I thrive under pressure and in fast-paced environments, always striving to stay a step ahead so my team can succeed. I served as a developmental engineer in the U.S. Air Force and Space Force, where I gained valuable experience in acquisition, systems engineering, and software development. As one of the Space Forces first-ever certified Supra Coders, I tackled high-profile projects that included writing and reviewing acquisition strategies for satellite constellations, deploying the first in-house RF deconfliction algorithm, and managing large-scale software and hardware systems valued at over $50B. I also served as class lead for the Space Forces inaugural Guardian Field Forum, collaborating with military professionals worldwide to address critical challengesan experience that strengthened my leadership and presentation skills in front of members of Congress, senior Pentagon officials, and top military leaders. After my military career, I joined Defense Unicornsa defense and government-focused startupwhere Ive continued honing my technical skills. I work with AI/ML-driven products, focusing on hardware optimization, containerization, Kubernetes operations, and both frontend (SvelteKit) and backend (FastAPI) development. My broad exposure to open-source and proprietary codebases allows me to rapidly design, test, deploy, and debug solutions while mentoring team members and partners. Prior to my service, I earned a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with minors in Communications and Military Leadership from Rochester Institute of Technology. I also pursued graduate coursework at Johns Hopkins and Georgia Tech in computer science, focusing on AI/ML and enterprise/web computing. Although I ultimately chose hands-on education over formal degree completion, these programs reinforced my dedication to continuous learning. Outside of work, I enjoy coding personal projects, gaming, running, traveling, and volunteering in my community. On the following pages, Ive included a curated set of recommendation letters from past and present peers and supervisors, also available on my LinkedIn profile for verification. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills can contribute to your organization. RECOMMENDATIONS I had the pleasure of working with Justin during one of his toughest assignments. He was tasked with leading over a dozen engineers to deliver a technical requirements review. Justin was under a lot of pressure with minimal guidance and was able to overcome all challenges and led the team in delivering a successful and extremely important review. I watched him work under tight deadlines and constant pivots. He was the first in and last out of the office. He is focused and understands when to lean on his team for support and when he needs to take the reins. He respects his teammates and always leads by example, which makes everyone working with him want to do better. I have always told Justin that he is ahead of his time in experience, knowledge, and maturity. I know that he is going to achieve great things in his future. I can honestly say that he is one of the brightest stars I have ever come across in all my professional years. If given the opportunity, I would happily work on his team anywhere. I vouch for Justins professionalism and work ethic and highly recommend him. Hovsep Gazayan Systems Engineer, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory LinkedIn Profile Justin is a forward-thinking, self-motivated, autonomous, fire and forget superstar employee and team leader. As a critical thinker and proactive closer, hes consistently at least 2-steps ahead of leadership and miles ahead of his peers.

He is dedicated, focused, and typically makes himself the expert on any topic hes assigned to. Hes a collaborative team player and a pleasure to work with. He will be an asset to any organization. He has my highest recommendation, and I know hell succeed in any company thats lucky enough to gain him. Laila Barasha Materiel Leader, Lt Col, United States Space Force LinkedIn Profile I worked with Justin Law in the Supra Coders program; he was knowledgeable and skilled in design and planning. He was able to teach and implement design products to ensure a seamless workflow between separate teams. Given the direction and coherence of the plan, Justin was able to lead two teams to create an integrated frontend UI and backend database. Justin is confident, able, and effective at creating a positive work environment driven by meaningful milestones. Justin would additionally research and tackle any complex problem, quickly developing and implementing comprehensive systems. I highly recommend Justin Law to lead teams, manage projects and programs, or solve intricate challenges. I would also recommend Justin for his strong communication skills, calm and bright demeanor, and outstanding professionalism. Mark Terry Cyber Operator, MSgt, United States Space Force LinkedIn Profile Justin came to Saber Astronautics through the USSF Supra Coder program. During his time with us he took one of our prototype products and transformed it into a fully deployed MVP. Justin was always hardworking, intelligent and just an all around lovely person to work with. We were very sorry to see him go at the end of his internship! Nathan Parrot Director of US Division, Saber Astronautics LinkedIn Profile I was extremely privileged to have had Justin as a trusted and dependable coworker and friend during his time in the United States Space Force (USSF). Justin was an extremely valuable asset to all of Space Systems Commands Strategic Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Acquisition Delta. Justins expert technical abilities stood out to both his direct and indirect leadership. While working as a ground system Agile development lead, Justin was selected as a Supra Coder advisor for the Chief Information Officer. As an advisor he worked toward the development of a USSF wide digital engineering platform. He championed both of these roles while simultaneously in pursuit of a masters degree in computer science from John Hopkins University. He is an incredibly driven, detail-oriented individual whos background in engineering would make him an ideal candidate as a software engineer. His genuine, charismatic personality allows him to easily integrate into any team he is placed in. His ability to actively propagate positive change throughout an organization is unremarkable. It is with the highest regard I recommend Justin. I have no doubts in his ability to succeed. Rebecca Miller Project Engineer, 1st Lt, United States Space Force LinkedIn Profile Justin Law was employed as an engineering co-op student in the Assay Manufacturing department of Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Rochester, NY, from January 2017 through August 2017. During his tenure, he: Created carts to facilitate standard work for preventive maintenance of automated manufacturing equipment. Analyzed data and designed improvements to a water jacket system for controlling temperature in mixing tanks. Designed and fabricated numerous custom fixtures to resolve manufacturing issues. Implemented mechanical improvements to a bench-top analytical device for measurement of blood chemistry Justin was conscientious, diligent, and thorough and received compliments from the many mechanics and engineers that he worked with. He solicited and utilized input from his coworkers. He organized his work schedule and delivered on commitments. I highly recommend him for a position that utilizes his admirable engineering and collaboration skills. Jim Pochodylo Principal Engineer, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics LinkedIn Profile",
