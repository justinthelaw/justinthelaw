At the linked website above, you will find an AI chatbot that is fine-tuned on synthetic datasets generated from my resume and cover letter, alongside a viewable and downloadable PDF version of my resume and cover letter.

> [!NOTE]
> You can fork and personalize my website by checking out the [customization guide](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md). The guide will show you how to configure the repository to use your information, and it will also walk you through the steps for fine-tuning an LLM on your own data.
> The fine-tuning pipeline now includes a deterministic evaluation suite (`make eval-smoke` / `make eval-full`) with threshold-based regression gating.
